//To create a database:
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name;

//To use a database:
USE database_name;

//To create a user
CREATE USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'userPassword';

//To delete (or drop) a user:
DROP USER 'user'@'hostname';

//To create a table:
Create Table table_name(
    id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    field_name2 TYPE,
    field_name3 TYPE,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
    );

//To see tables in a database:
SHOW TABLES;

//To see the contents of a table:
DESCRIBE table_name;

//To see the structure of a database:
SHOW CREATE DATABASE database_name;

//Deleting a table:
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;

//Granting privileges to a user:
*Granting all permissions*
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'billy'@'localhost';

*Granting selective permissions*
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'read_only'@'localhost';
(where the first * is the database name and the second * is the table name)
and
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON sally_db.sallys_table TO 'sally'@'localhost';
(for other privileges)

*Granting all permissions and grant privileges*
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'billy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

//Listing users:
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

//Use the INSERT statement to create data
INSERT INTO table_name (field1, field2, ...)
VALUES ('value1', 'value2', ...);

EX:
for this quotes table...

CREATE TABLE quotes (
    author_first_name VARCHAR(50),
    author_last_name  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL
);

step1:
INSERT INTO quotes(author_first_name,author_last_name_content)
VALUES ('Charles', 'Lemagne','Knowing a second language is to have a second soul.')
** apostrophes need a second tic or a backslash right before
** double quotes can be used

step2:
specify the database you want it to go into

//Use the SELECT statement to read data
SELECT * FROM quotes;
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;

EX:
SELECT author_last_name, content FROM quotes;

//Where Clause
 As we can see, SELECT will return all the rows in our table. If we want to
 change what data is being returned, we need to narrow down our selection. We can do this
  by using a WHERE clause. WHERE allows you to specify a condition that must be true for a
  given row to be displayed. The basic syntax looks like:

  EXAMPLE :

  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name = 'value';

Notice that for comparison SQL uses just a single = and not the double == we have used before.
For example, if we wanted all the quotes written by 'Adams' we could do:
SELECT * FROM quotes WHERE author_last_name = 'Adams';

Also remember, the guaranteed fastest and most precise way to find a single record in a table
is to use the table's primary key:

SELECT * FROM quotes WHERE id = 5;

//Use the UPDATE statement to update data
  Use the DELETE statement to delete data
